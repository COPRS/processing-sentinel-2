## Content

The User Manual is split in two documents (hereafter named "release notes") that each explain the deployment and configuration of an rs-addon.

Note: The term "release notes" for rs-addon deployment and configuration shall be renamed later to avoid confusion with Software release notes.

Please refer to the release notes:

- [rs-addon S2_L0U release note](./../../rs-addons/S2_L0U/Release_Note.md)
- [rs-addon S2_L0C release note](./../../rs-addons/S2_L0C/Release_Note.md)
